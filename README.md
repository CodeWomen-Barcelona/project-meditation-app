## Project Meditation App

### The goal of this project is to practice working with HTML and CSS, including sound files

We will be using HTML, CSS, icons and background images, and .mp3 sound files. For more advanced functionality, including video, JavaScript will be used.

**Basic functionality:** we want to offer the user two options for ambient sound (rain or sea). The user can enjoy the sound by picking one of three options of listening time (2, 5 or 10 minutes).

**Additional functionality:** the user can see a timer countdown on the screen and video is added to the app. This will require JavaScript.

This is what the app will look like, using the icons and images in the starter code of the project (see assets folder):  

<img src="/meditation_screenshot.png" width="600" />Â 

### For starters

1. Create a new folder on your local computer with the name: project-gnome-fetcher
1. Track your code with Git by using `git init` in the terminal
1. Create an index.html file with the general template code
1. Create a style.css file and add this to your HTML file as `<link>` (check how to add CSS to an HTML file)
1. Make sure you have *Meditation App* as the title (this will show in the tab when your app runs in the browser)
1. For the background image, you can use the `meditation_bg.jpg` file or another photograph you like
1. The icons you need for the webpage are in the assets folder (but feel free to search for others you would like to use)
1. Build the page according to the example. You can use Flexbox to position the elements in the right place, if you know how to use it (there is a project called **flexbox-practice** in the CodeWomen repositories, if you would like to get better at using Flexbox)




***For Intermediate/Advanced Level ***
 -Use Javascript to make those button working with the timer and play button 
 -Give the functionality to change the play button change into pause while playing the music
*** Optional ****
 - Use video in the  background
 - Use those right side buttons to change the background and sound on 'Click'



Steps:

Create a new folder on your local computer with the name: project-meditation-app
Create an index.html file with the general template code
Create a style.css file and add this to your HTML file as <link> (check how to add CSS to an HTML file)
Make sure you have Meditation App as the title in your HTML (this will show in the tab when your app runs in the browser)
Build the page according to the example (try to find the correct font!)
You will be able to find the relevants image,sounds and videos on "assests","sounds" and "videos" folder respectively.
You can use any photographs you like, change the cities, etc.
Feel free to use Bootstrap if you also want to practise that ðŸ˜Š
