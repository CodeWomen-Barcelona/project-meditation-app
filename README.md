## Project Meditation App

### The goal of this project is to practice working with HTML and CSS, including sound files

We will be using HTML, CSS, icons and background images, and .mp3 sound files. For more advanced functionality, including video, JavaScript will be used.

**Basic functionality:** we want to offer the user two options for ambient sound (rain or sea). The user can enjoy the sound by picking one of three options of listening time (2, 5 or 10 minutes).

**Additional functionality:** the user can see a timer countdown on the screen and video is added to the app. This will require JavaScript.

This is what the app will look like, using the icons and images in the starter code of the project (see assets folder):  

<img src="/meditation_screenshot.png" width="600" />Â 

### For starters

1. Create a new folder on your local computer with the name: project-gnome-fetcher
1. Track your code with Git by using `git init` in the terminal
1. Create an index.html file with the general template code
1. Create a style.css file and add this to your HTML file as `<link>` (check how to add CSS to an HTML file)
1. Make sure you have *Meditation App* as the title (this will show in the tab when your app runs in the browser)
1. For the background image, you can use the `meditation_bg.jpg` file or another photograph you like
1. The icons you need for the webpage are in the assets folder (but feel free to search for others you would like to use)
1. Build the page according to the example. You can use Flexbox to position the elements in the right place, if you know how to use it (there is a project called **flexbox-practice** in the CodeWomen repositories, if you would like to get better at using Flexbox)
1. Feel free to use Bootstrap if you also want to practise that ðŸ˜Š
1. Add icons to the buttons, and add hover effect for these buttons
1. When the rain button is clicked, the background should change to the rain_image.png, and when the sun button is clicked, the background should change to show the sea_image.jpg. 
1. If you want to challenge yourself, try to make the app responsive by adding media queries for mobile, tablet and desktop
1. You can run the app in the browser with LiveServer (a VSC extension)

### For more advanced students

1. Follow the steps in the instructions above to build the webpage
1. Use JavaScript to build a timer that starts running as soon as one of the time options is clicked, and stops when the time has expired (if you like, you can add a gentle sound as an alert, to indicate the time has run out)
1. Use JavaScript to activate an .mp3 file when one of the ambient sound buttons is clicked (there are two sound files in the sounds folder)
1. Disable the click functionality of the buttons on click (this means that once a button is clicked, it cannot be clicked again until the action is finished)
1. Make sure the background changes with the choice of the user of an ambient sound (rain or beach)
1. Change the `play` icon of the play button to a `pause` icon when the button is clicked, and change it back again when the button is clicked
1. Stop the music when the `pause` is clicked, and restart when the button is clicked again
1. Challenge yourself: use video as background instead of images (see video files in folder)
